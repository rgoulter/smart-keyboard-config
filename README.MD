# Smart Keymap User Configuration

Repository with user-defined keyboards and keymaps
 for [smart-keymap](https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap)-based firmware.


## Dependencies

[DevEnv](https://devenv.sh/) is used to provide the toolchain dependencies.

Use `devenv shell` to enter a shell which has all the tooling installed.

A [DevContainer](https://containers.dev/) is defined for the project, which can be used to easily get started using [e.g. VSCode, GitHub Codespaces, etc.](https://containers.dev/supporting).
